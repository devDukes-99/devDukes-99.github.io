# Growth-Mindset

Growth-Mindset in my own words:

- A lot will have an opinion on what it means to have and maintain a growth mindset but not all will endure the grind. A Growth mindset in my words is a personal change in daily habits and your way of thinking overall, and everyones limitations and drive is different.
 
- For me I can get in a better routine, maybe wake up earlier consistanly and be productive, I cannot get those hours back so the thought of losing time brings motivation.
 
- A growth mindset is a way of thinking, being stuck on a difficult task can be very fraustrating and finding a way to overcome those without quiting is growing a better mindset, just keeping that ability to focus and fight.

- Finding more than one way to overcome adversities will help anyone succeed in their goals.
**like the words from my favorite athlete:**
> “Don’t be afraid of failure. 
> This is the way to succeed.” – LeBron James

## 3 ways I like to remind myself to keep a growth-mindset
- Set reminders 📱:
-- A simple alarm clock/timer app on my phone is one way I like to remind myself to keep that growth-mindset, I set a note on my app to remind myself where I left off.

- Take a short motivation-break 🔋:
-- short breaks taking my mind off a difficult task or getting stuck on in high-level error(s) where nothing seems to be working is when I usually take a motivation-break that consists of maybe making a nice snack and watch sports momentarily. This is when I usually will solve a problem with a calmer mind and more patient and less susceptible to my flaws.  

- Consistency 💹: They say it 21 days to form a habit and to me that can mean mentally as well, but staying true to my new daily habits/ critical thinking habbits I can develope a more organized and complete mindset	:lotus_position_man:.[The Quote Below](https://www.lifehack.org/889488/habits-quotes):v:
