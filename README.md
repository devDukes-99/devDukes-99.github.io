# Growth-Mindset

- A lot will have an opinion on what it means to have and maintain a growth mindset but not all will endure the grind. A Growth mindset in my words is a personal change in daily habits and your way of thinking overall, and everyones limitations and drive is different.
 
- For me I can get in a better routine, maybe wake up earlier consistanly and be productive those days are always my best. You can put in work earlier because no one can get those hours back and time sleping in is time I could be using to perfect my craft.
 
- A growths mindset is a way of thinking, being stuck on a difficult task can be very fraustrating and finding a way to overcome those without quiting is growing a better mindset. 

- finding more than one way to overcome adversities will help anyone succeed in their goals.
**like the words from my favorite athlete:**
> “Don’t be afraid of failure. 
> This is the way to succeed.” – LeBron James

## 3 ways i like to remind myself to keep a growth-mindset
- Set reminders 📱:
-- A simple alarm clock/timer app on my phone is one way I like to remind myself to keep that growth-mindset, I set a note on my app to remind myself where I left off.

- Take a short motivation-break 🔋:
-- short breaks taking my mind off a difficult task or getting stuck on in high-level error(s) where nothing seems to be working is when I usually take a motivation-break that consists of maybe making a nice snack and watch sports momentarily. This is when I usually will solve a problem with a calmer mind and more patient and less susceptible to my flaws.  

- Consistency 💹: Staying true to my new habits and develope a more organized mindset	:lotus_position_man:.
