# Growth-Mindset

- A lot will have an opinion on what it means to have and maintain a growth mindset but not all will endure the grind. A Growth mindset in my words is a personal change in daily habits and your way of thinking overall, and everyones limitations and drive is different. 
- For me even waking up earlier and eating earlier before I start my work is a form of growth mindset, but its all a personal opinion depending on the situation. 
- A growths mindset is a way of thinking, being stuck on a difficult task can be very fraustrating and finding a way to overcome those without quiting is growing a better mindset. 
- finding more than one way to overcome adversities will help anyone succeed in their goals.
**like the words from my favorite athlete:**
> “Don’t be afraid of failure. 
> This is the way to succeed.” – LeBron James
